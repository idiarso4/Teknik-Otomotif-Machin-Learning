# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rebuilding an AI-powered automotive simulation application designed specifically for SMK Teknik Otomotif (Automotive Engineering Vocational School) SMK Negeri 1 Punggelan. The application serves as a comprehensive interactive learning platform that combines real-time sensor simulation, AI-based fault detection, Arduino integration, and educational modules to enhance automotive engineering education.

The system will provide students and instructors with hands-on experience in automotive diagnostics, sensor data analysis, embedded programming, and AI-powered fault detection through a modern, responsive web-based interface. The application will be built using Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4, and shadcn/ui components, incorporating the modern scaffold architecture you've outlined.
